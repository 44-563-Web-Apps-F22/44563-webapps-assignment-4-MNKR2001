    SCENE.Pavilion in the Court of Barataria.  Marco and
    Giuseppe, magnificently dressed, are seated on two thrones,
    occupied in cleaning the crown and the sceptre.  The Gondoliers
    are discovered, dressed, some as courtiers, officers of rank,
    etc., and others as private soldiers and servants of various
    degrees.  All are enjoying themselves without reference to social
    distinctions—some playing cards, others throwing dice, some
    reading, others playing cup and ball, "morra", etc.

                <p  class="song"> CHORUS OF MEN with MARCO and GIUSEPPE.
  
              Of happiness the very pith
                             In Barataria you may see:
              A monarchy that's tempered with
                             Republican Equality.
              This form of government we find
              The beau ideal of its kind—
              A despotism strict combined
                             With absolute equality!
  
                           MARCO and GIUSEPPE.
  
              Two kings, of undue pride bereft,
                             Who act in perfect unity,
              Whom you can order right and left
                             With absolute impunity.
              Who put their subjects at their ease
              By doing all they can to please!
              And thus, to earn their bread-and-cheese,
                             Seize every opportunity.
                            </p>
   <h6 class="name MAR">MAR</h6> 
         <p class="speech"> Gentlemen, we are much obliged to you for your
    expressions of satisfaction and good feeling—I say, we are much
    obliged to you for your expressions of satisfaction and good
    feeling.</p>
         <h6 class="name ALL" >ALL</h6> 
         <p class="speech"> We heard you.</p>
         <h6 class="name MAR">MAR</h6> 
         <p class="speech"> We are delighted, at any time, to fall in with
    sentiments so charmingly expressed.</p>
    <h6 class="name ALL" >ALL</h6> 
    <p class="speech"> That's all right.</p>
    <h6 class="name GIU">GIU</h6> 
    <p class="speech"> At the same time there is just one little grievance
    that we should like to ventilate.</p>
    <h6 class="name ALL" >ALL</h6>
    <p class="speech">What?</p> 
         <h6 class="name GIU" >GIU</h6> 
         <p class="speech"> Don't be alarmed—it's not serious.  It is arranged
    that, until it is decided which of us two is the actual King, we
    are to act as one person.</p>
         <h6 class="name GIO">GIO</h6> 
         <p class="speech"> Exactly.</p>
         <h6 class="name GIU">GIU</h6>  
         <p class="speech">Now, although we act as one person, we are, in point
    of fact, two persons.</p>
    <br>
         <h6 class="name ANN">ANN</h6> 
         <p class="speech"> Ah, I don't think we can go into that.  It is a
    legal fiction, and legal fictions are solemn things.  Situated as
    we are, we can't recognize two independent responsibilities.</p>
<h6 class="name GIU" >GIU</h6>  
    <p class="speech">No; but you can recognize two independent appetites.
    It's all very well to say we act as one person, but when you
    supply us with only one ration between us, I should describe it
    as a legal fiction carried a little too far.</p>
    <h6 class="name ANN">ANN</h6> 
    <p class="speech"> It's rather a nice point.  I don't like to express an
    opinion off-hand.Suppose we reserve it for argument before the
    full Court?</p>
    <br>
    <h6 class="name MAR">MAR</h6>  
    <p class="speech">Yes, but what are we to do in the meantime?</p>
    <h6 class="name MAR and GIU">MAR and GIU</h6> 
    <p class="speech"> We want our tea.</p>
    <h6 class="name ANN" >ANN</h6> 
    <p class="speech"> I think we may make an interim order for double
    rations on their Majesties entering into the usual undertaking to
    indemnify in the event of an adverse decision?</p>
         <h6 class="name GIO" >GIO</h6> 
         <p class="speech"> That, I think, will meet the case.  But you must work
    hard—stick to it—nothing like work.</p>
    <h6 class="name GIU" >GIU</h6> 
    <p class="speech"> Oh, certainly.  We quite understand that a man who
    holds the magnificent position of King should do something to
    justify it.  We are called "Your Majesty"; we are allowed to buy
    ourselves magnificent clothes; our subjects frequently nod to us
    in the streets; the sentries always return our salutes; and we
    enjoy the inestimable privilege of heading the subscription lists
    to all the principal charities.  In return for these advantages
    the least we can do is to make ourselves useful about the Palace.</p>

         We proceed to light the fire,

         In its workaday attire,
              We embark without delay
              On the duties of the day.]
